The text below contains an academic paper. Extract sentences requiring citations from the provided text below, so they can be provided to a citation research system. The author's beliefs, opinions, or definitions do not require citation. Number each sentences requiring a citations as a separate line, with no other commentary. Preserve the text of sentences closely and put them in quotes. If (and only if) the sentence lacks important context, such as the subject area, that would be needed for the citation research system to properly evaluate the sentence and find references, then include that context after the claim in square brackets, such as "[in the field of environmental law]".
