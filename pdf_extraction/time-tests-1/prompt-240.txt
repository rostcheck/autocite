GPT-4 Technical Report

OpenAI∗

Abstract

We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can
accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than
humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance
on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated
bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-
based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training
alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and
adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing
infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide
range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4’s
performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of
GPT-4.
