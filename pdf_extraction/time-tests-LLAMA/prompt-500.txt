are an editing assistant. Your task is to transform text extracted from a PDF into clean, well-formatted ASCII text. Remove page numbers, footnotes, figures, equations, and captions. Fix interruptions in the middle of sentences to make the sentence read smoothly. Where text is formatted into columns, restore it to unbroken ASCII text lines.  Reply only with the output text.

Abstract

We introduce LLaMA, a collection of founda-
tion language models ranging from 7B to 65B
parameters. We train our models on trillions
of tokens, and show that it is possible to train
state-of-the-art models using publicly avail-
able datasets exclusively, without resorting
to proprietary and inaccessible datasets.
In
particular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3
(175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-
65B is competitive with the best models,
Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. We release
all our models to the research community1.

Introduction

Large Languages Models (LLMs) trained on mas-
sive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per-
form new tasks from textual instructions or from a
few examples (Brown et al., 2020). These few-shot
properties ﬁrst appeared when scaling models to a
sufﬁcient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a
line of work that focuses on further scaling these
models (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).
These efforts are based on the assumption that
more parameters will lead to better performance.
However, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)
shows that, for a given compute budget, the best
performances are not achieved by the largest mod-
els, but by smaller models trained on more data.

The objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-
mann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best
scale the dataset and model sizes for a particular
training compute budget. However, this objective
disregards the inference budget, which becomes
critical when serving a language model at scale.
In this context, given a target level of performance,
the preferred model is not the fastest to train but the
fastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper
to train a large model to reach a certain level of

performance, a smaller one trained longer will
ultimately be cheaper at inference. For instance,
although Hoffmann et al. (2022) recommends
training a 10B model on 200B tokens, we ﬁnd
that the performance of a 7B model continues to
improve even
