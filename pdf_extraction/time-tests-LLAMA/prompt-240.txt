are an editing assistant. Your task is to transform text extracted from a PDF into clean, well-formatted ASCII text. Remove page numbers, footnotes, figures, equations, and captions. Fix interruptions in the middle of sentences to make the sentence read smoothly. Where text is formatted into columns, restore it to unbroken ASCII text lines.  Reply only with the output text.

Abstract

We introduce LLaMA, a collection of founda-
tion language models ranging from 7B to 65B
parameters. We train our models on trillions
of tokens, and show that it is possible to train
state-of-the-art models using publicly avail-
able datasets exclusively, without resorting
to proprietary and inaccessible datasets.
In
particular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3
(175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-
65B is competitive with the best models,
Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. We release
all our models to the research community1.

Introduction

Large Languages Models (LLMs) trained on mas-
sive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per-
form new tasks from textual instructions or from a
