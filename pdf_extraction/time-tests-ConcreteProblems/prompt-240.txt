Abstract

Rapid progress in machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) has brought increasing atten-
tion to the potential impacts of AI technologies on society. In this paper we discuss one such
potential impact: the problem of accidents in machine learning systems, deﬁned as unintended
and harmful behavior that may emerge from poor design of real-world AI systems. We present a
list of ﬁve practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether
the problem originates from having the wrong objective function (“avoiding side eﬀects” and
“avoiding reward hacking”), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently
(“scalable supervision”), or undesirable behavior during the learning process (“safe exploration”
and “distributional shift”).
