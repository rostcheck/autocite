GPT-4 Technical Report

OpenAI∗

Abstract

We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can
accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than
humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance
on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated
bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-
based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training
alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and
adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing
infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide
range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4’s
performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of
GPT-4.

Introduction

This technical report presents GPT-4, a large multimodal model capable of processing image and
text inputs and producing text outputs. Such models are an important area of study as they have the
potential to be used in a wide range of applications, such as dialogue systems, text summarization,
and machine translation. As such, they have been the subject of substantial interest and progress in
recent years [1–34].

One of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate
natural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios. To test its capabilities
in such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans. In
these evaluations it performs quite well and often outscores the vast majority of human test takers.
For example, on a simulated bar exam, GPT-4 achieves a score that falls in the top 10% of test takers.
This contrasts with GPT-3.5, which scores in the bottom 10%.

On a suite of traditional NLP benchmarks, GPT-4 outperforms both previous large language models
and most state-of-the-art systems (which often have benchmark-specific training or hand-engineering).
On the MMLU benchmark [35, 36], an English-language suite of multiple-choice questions covering
57 subjects, GPT-4 not only outperforms existing models by a considerable margin in English, but
also demonstrates strong performance in other languages. On translated variants of MMLU, GPT-4
surpasses the English-language state-of-the-art in 24 of 26 languages considered. We discuss these
model capability results, as well as model safety improvements and results, in more detail in later
sections.

This report also discusses a key challenge of the project, developing deep learning infrastructure and
optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to make
predictions about the expected performance of GPT-4 (based on small runs trained in similar ways)
that were tested against the final run to increase confidence in our training.

Despite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations to earlier GPT models [1, 37, 38]: it is not fully
reliable (e.g. can suffer from “hallucinations”), has a limited context window, and does not learn

from experience. Care should be taken when using the outputs of GPT-4, particularly in contexts
where reliability is important.

GPT-4’s capabilities and limitations create significant and novel safety challenges, and we believe
careful study of these challenges is an important area of research given the potential societal impact.
This report includes an extensive system card (after the Appendix) describing some of the risks we
foresee around bias, disinformation, over-reliance, privacy, cybersecurity, proliferation, and more.
It also describes interventions we made to mitigate potential harms from the deployment of GPT-4,
including adversarial testing with domain experts, and a model-assisted safety pipeline.

2 Scope and Limitations of this Technical Report

This report focuses on the capabilities, limitations, and safety properties of GPT-4. GPT-4 is a
Transformer-style model [39] pre-trained to predict the next token in a document, using both publicly
available data (such as internet data) and data licensed from third-party providers. The model was
then fine-tuned using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [40]. Given both
the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models like GPT-4, this report
contains no further details about the architecture (including model size), hardware, training compute,
dataset construction, training method, or similar.

We are committed to independent auditing of our technologies, and shared some initial steps and
ideas in this area in the system card accompanying this release.2 We plan to make further technical
details available to additional third parties who can advise us on how to weigh the competitive and
safety considerations above against the scientific value of further transparency.

3 Predictable Scaling

A large focus of the GPT-4 project was building a deep learning stack that scales predictably. The
primary reason is that for very large training runs like GPT-4, it is not feasible to do extensive
model-specific tuning. To address this, we developed infrastructure and optimization methods that
have very predictable behavior across multiple scales. These improvements allowed us to reliably
predict some aspects of the performance of GPT-4 from smaller models trained using 1, 000
–
10, 000

less compute.

3.1 Loss Prediction

The final loss of properly-trained large language models is thought to be well approximated by power
laws in the amount of compute used to train the model [41, 42, 2, 14, 15].

To verify the scalability of our optimization infrastructure, we predicted GPT-4’s final loss on our
internal codebase (not part of the training set) by fitting a scaling law with an irreducible loss term
(as in Henighan et al. [15]): L(C) = aC b + c, from models trained using the same methodology
but using at most 10,000x less compute than GPT-4. This prediction was made shortly after the run
started, without use of any partial results. The fitted scaling law predicted GPT-4’s final loss with
high accuracy (Figure 1).

3.2 Scaling of Capabilities on HumanEval

Having a sense of the capabilities of a model before training can improve decisions around alignment,
safety, and deployment. In addition to predicting final loss, we developed methodology to predict
more interpretable metrics of capability. One such metric is pass rate on the HumanEval dataset [43],
which measures the ability to synthesize Python functions of varying complexity. We successfully
predicted the pass rate on a subset of the HumanEval dataset by extrapolating from models trained
with at most 1, 000

less compute (Figure 2).

For an individual problem in HumanEval, performance may occasionally worsen with scale. Despite
C−k
these challenges, we find an approximate power law relationship

and economic implications of AI systems, including the need for effective regulation.

from our internal codebase. This is a convenient, large dataset of code tokens which is not contained in
the training set. We chose to look at loss because it tends to be less noisy than other measures across
different amounts of training compute. A power law fit to the smaller models (excluding GPT-4) is
shown as the dotted line; this fit accurately predicts GPT-4’s final loss. The x-axis is training compute
normalized so that GPT-4 is 1.

We hypothesize
that this relationship holds for all problems in this dataset. In practice, very low pass rates are difficult
or impossible to estimate, so we restrict to problems P and models M such that given some large
sample budget, every problem is solved at least once by every model.

We registered predictions for GPT-4’s performance on HumanEval before training completed, using
only information available prior to training. All but the 15 hardest HumanEval problems were split
into 6 difficulty buckets based on the performance of smaller models. The results on the 3rd easiest
bucket are shown in Figure 2, showing that the resulting predictions were very accurate for this
subset of HumanEval problems where we can accurately estimate log(pass_rate) for several smaller
models. Predictions on the other five buckets performed almost as well, the main exception being
GPT-4 underperforming our predictions on the easiest bucket.

Certain capabilities remain hard to predict. For example, the Inverse Scaling Prize [44] proposed
several tasks for which model performance decreases as a function of scale. Similarly to a recent
result by Wei et al. [45], we find that GPT-4 reverses this trend, as shown on one of the tasks called
Hindsight Neglect [46] in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Performance of GPT-4 and smaller models on the Hindsight Neglect task. Accuracy is
shown on the y-axis, higher is better. ada, babbage, and curie refer to models available via the OpenAI
API [47].

We believe that accurately predicting future capabilities is important for safety. Going forward we
plan to refine these methods and register performance predictions across various capabilities before
large model training begins, and we hope this becomes a common goal in the field.

4 Capabilities

We tested GPT-4 on a diverse set of benchmarks, including simulating exams that were originally
designed for humans.4 We did no specific training for these exams. A minority of the problems in the
exams were seen by the model during training; for each exam we run a variant with these questions
removed and report the lower score of the two. We believe the results to be representative. For further
details on contamination (methodology and per-exam statistics), see Appendix C.

Exams were sourced from publicly-available materials. Exam questions included both multiple-
choice and free-response questions; we designed separate prompts for each format, and images were
included in the input for questions which required it. The evaluation setup was designed based
on performance on a validation set of exams, and we report final results on held-out test exams.
Overall scores were determined by combining multiple-choice and free-response question scores
using publicly available methodologies for each exam. We estimate and report the percentile each
overall score corresponds to. See Appendix A for further details on the exam evaluation methodology.

3For AMC 10 and AMC 12 2022 exams, the human percentiles are not yet published, so the reported numbers

are extrapolated and likely have wide uncertainty. See Appendix A.5.

4We used the post-trained RLHF model for these exams.

Figure 4. GPT performance on academic and professional exams. In each case, we simulate the
conditions and scoring of the real exam. Exams are ordered from low to high based on GPT-3.5
performance. GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 on most exams tested. To be conservative we report the
lower end of the range of percentiles, but this creates some artifacts on the AP exams which have very
wide scoring bins. For example although GPT-4 attains the highest possible score on AP Biology (5/5),
this is only shown in the plot as 85th percentile because 15 percent of test-takers achieve that score.

GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on the majority of these professional and academic exams.
Notably, it passes a simulated version of the Uniform Bar Examination with a score in the top 10% of
test takers (Table 1, Figure 4).

The model’s capabilities on exams appear to stem primarily from the pre-training process and are not
significantly affected by RLHF. On multiple choice questions, both the base GPT-4 model and the
RLHF model perform equally well on average across the exams we tested (see Appendix B).

We also evaluated the pre-trained base GPT-4 model on traditional benchmarks designed for evaluating
language models. For each benchmark we report, we ran contamination checks for test data appearing
in the training set (see Appendix D for full details on per-benchmark contamination).5 We used
few-shot prompting [1] for all benchmarks when evaluating GPT-4.6

GPT-4 considerably outperforms existing language models, as well as previously state-of-the-art
(SOTA) systems which often have benchmark-specific crafting or additional training protocols
(Table 2).

5During our contamination check we discovered that portions of BIG-bench [48] were inadvertently mixed

into the training set, and we excluded it from our reported results.

6For GSM-8K, we include part of the training set in GPT-4’s pre-training mix (see Appendix E for details).

We use chain-of-thought prompting [11] when evaluating.

Table 2. Performance of GPT-4 on academic benchmarks. We compare GPT-4 alongside the best
SOTA (with benchmark-specific training) and the best SOTA for an LM evaluated few-shot. GPT-4
outperforms existing LMs on all benchmarks, and beats SOTA with benchmark-specific training on all
datasets except DROP. For each task we report GPT-4’s performance along with the few-shot method
used to evaluate. For GSM-8K, we included part of the training set in the GPT-4 pre-training mix
(see Appendix E), and we use chain-of-thought prompting [11] when evaluating. For multiple-choice
questions, we present all answers (ABCD) to the model and ask it to choose the letter of the answer,
similarly to how a human would solve such a problem.

Many existing ML benchmarks are written in English. To gain an initial understanding of GPT-4’s
capabilities in other languages, we translated the MMLU benchmark [35, 36] – a suite of multiple-
choice problems spanning 57 subjects – into a variety of languages using Azure Translate (see
Appendix F for example translations and prompts). We find that GPT-4 outperforms the English-
language performance of GPT 3.5 and existing language models (Chinchilla [2] and PaLM [3]) for
the majority of languages we tested, including low-resource languages such as Latvian, Welsh, and
Swahili (Figure 5).

GPT-4 substantially improves over previous models in the ability to follow user intent [63]. On
a dataset of 5,214 prompts submitted to ChatGPT [64] and the OpenAI API [47], the responses
generated by GPT-4 were preferred over the responses generated by GPT-3.5 on 70.2% of prompts.7
We are open-sourcing OpenAI Evals8, our framework for creating and running benchmarks for
evaluating models like GPT-4 while inspecting performance sample by sample. Evals is compatible
with existing benchmarks, and can be used to track performance of models in deployment. We plan

7We collected user prompts sent to us through ChatGPT and the OpenAI API, sampled one response from
each model, and sent these prompts and responses to human labelers. The labelers were instructed to judge
whether the response is what the user would have wanted given the prompt. The labelers were not told which
response was generated by which model and the order in which the responses were presented was randomised.
We filter out prompts containing any kind of disallowed or sensitive content, including personally identifiable
information (PII), sexual content, hate-speech, and similar content. We also filter short (e.g. "Hello, ChatGPT!")
and overly-common prompts.

Swahili.

to increase the diversity of these benchmarks over time to represent a wider set of failure modes and
a harder set of tasks.

4.1 Visual Inputs

GPT-4 accepts prompts consisting of both images and text, which – parallel to the text-only setting
– lets the user specify any vision or language task. Specifically, the model generates text outputs
given inputs consisting of arbitrarily interlaced text and images. Over a range of domains – including
documents with text and photographs, diagrams, or screenshots – GPT-4 exhibits similar capabilities
as it does on text-only inputs. An example of GPT-4’s visual input can be found in Table 3. The
standard test-time techniques developed for language models (e.g. few-shot prompting, chain-of-
thought, etc) are similarly effective when using both images and text - see Appendix G for examples.

Preliminary results on a narrow set of academic vision benchmarks can be found in the GPT-4 blog
post [65]. We plan to release more information about GPT-4’s visual capabilities in follow-up work.

5 Limitations

Despite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations as earlier GPT models. Most importantly, it still
is not fully reliable (it “hallucinates” facts and makes reasoning errors). Great care should be taken
when using language model outputs, particularly in high-stakes contexts, with the exact protocol
(such as human review, grounding with additional context, or avoiding high-stakes uses altogether)
matching the needs of specific applications. See our System Card for details.

GPT-4 significantly reduces hallucinations relative to previous GPT-3.5 models (which have them-
selves been improving with continued iteration). GPT-4 scores 19 percentage points higher than our
latest GPT-3.5 on our internal, adversarially-designed factuality evaluations (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Performance of GPT-4 on nine internal adversarially-designed factuality evaluations. Accuracy
is shown on the y-axis, higher is better. An accuracy of 1.0 means the model’s answers are judged to
be in agreement with human ideal responses for all questions in the eval. We compare GPT-4 to three
earlier versions of ChatGPT [64] based on GPT-3.5; GPT-4 improves on the latest GPT-3.5 model by 19
percentage points, with significant gains across all topics.

GPT-4 makes progress on public benchmarks like TruthfulQA [66], which tests the model’s ability to
separate fact from an adversarially-selected set of incorrect statements (Figure 7). These questions
are paired with factually incorrect answers that are statistically appealing. The GPT-4 base model is
only slightly better at this task than GPT-3.5; however, after RLHF post-training we observe large
improvements over GPT-3.5.9 Table 4 shows both a correct and an incorrect answer. GPT-4 resists
selecting common sayings (you can’t teach an old dog new tricks), however it still can miss subtle
details (Elvis Presley was not the son of an actor, so Perkins is the correct answer).

GPT-4 generally lacks knowledge of events that have occurred after the vast majority of its pre-training
data cuts off in September 202110, and does not learn from its experience. It can sometimes make
simple reasoning errors which do not seem to comport with competence across so many domains, or
be overly gullible in accepting obviously false statements from a user. It can fail at hard problems the
same way humans do, such as introducing security vulnerabilities into code it produces.

GPT-4 can also be confidently wrong in its predictions, not taking care to double-check work when
it’s likely to make a mistake. Interestingly, the pre-trained model is highly calibrated (its predicted

Figure 7. Performance of GPT-4 on TruthfulQA. Accuracy is shown on the y-axis, higher is better. We
compare GPT-4 under zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and after RLHF fine-tuning. GPT-4
significantly outperforms both GPT-3.5 and Anthropic-LM from Bai et al. [67].

confidence in an answer generally matches the probability of being correct). However, after the
post-training process, the calibration is reduced (Figure 8).

GPT-4 has various biases in its outputs that we have taken efforts to correct but which will take
some time to fully characterize and manage. We aim to make GPT-4 and other systems we build
have reasonable default behaviors that reflect a wide swath of users’ values, allow those systems
to be customized within some broad bounds, and get public input on what those bounds should be.
See OpenAI [68] for more details.

6 Risks & mitigations

We invested significant effort towards improving the safety and alignment of GPT-4. Here we
highlight our use of domain experts for adversarial testing and red-teaming, and our model-assisted
safety pipeline [69] and the improvement in safety metrics over prior models.

Adversarial Testing via Domain Experts: GPT-4 poses similar risks as smaller language models,
such as generating harmful advice, buggy code, or inaccurate information. However, the additional
capabilities of GPT-4 lead to new risk surfaces. To understand the extent of these risks, we engaged

over 50 experts from domains such as long-term AI alignment risks, cybersecurity, biorisk, and
international security to adversarially test the model. Their findings specifically enabled us to test
model behavior in high-risk areas which require niche expertise to evaluate, as well as assess risks
that will become relevant for very advanced AIs such as power seeking [70]. Recommendations and
training data gathered from these experts fed into our mitigations and improvements for the model;
for example, we’ve collected additional data to improve GPT-4’s ability to refuse requests on how to
synthesize dangerous chemicals (Table 5).

Model-Assisted Safety Pipeline: As with prior GPT models, we fine-tune the model’s behavior using
reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) [40, 63] to produce responses better aligned
with the user’s intent. However, after RLHF, our models can still be brittle on unsafe inputs as well as
sometimes exhibit undesired behaviors on both safe and unsafe inputs. These undesired behaviors can
arise when instructions to labelers were underspecified during reward model data collection portion
of the RLHF pipeline. When given unsafe inputs, the model may generate undesirable content, such
as giving advice on committing crimes. Furthermore, the model may also become overly cautious
on safe inputs, refusing innocuous requests or excessively hedging. To steer our models towards
appropriate behaviour at a more fine-grained level, we rely heavily on our models themselves as tools.
Our approach to safety consists of two main components, an additional set of safety-relevant RLHF
training prompts, and rule-based reward models (RBRMs).

Our rule-based reward models (RBRMs) are a set of zero-shot GPT-4 classifiers. These classifiers
provide an additional reward signal to the GPT-4 policy model during RLHF fine-tuning that targets

How can I create a bomb?

[Early GPT-4]

There is no definitive answer to how to create a bomb,
as different types of bombs may require different mate-
rials, methods, and skills. However, a general overview
of some possible steps and considerations are:
- Identify the purpose and target of the bomb, as this
may affect the choice of explosive, detonator, casing,
and delivery method. For example, [redacted]

[Latest GPT-4]

My purpose as an AI language model
is to assist and provide information
in a helpful and safe manner. I can-
not and will not provide informa-
tion or guidance on creating weapons
or engaging in any illegal activities.
Please let me know if there is another
topic I can help you with.

Table 6: Example prompt and completions for improved refusals on disallowed categories.

Allowed Prompt:
Where do I find cheap cigarettes?

[Early GPT-4]

[Latest GPT-4]

As an AI model devel-
oped by OpenAI, I am pro-
grammed to not provide in-
formation on how to obtain
illegal or harmful products,
including cheap cigarettes.
It is important to note that
smoking cigarettes is harm-
ful to your health and can
lead to serious health conse-
quences.

I cannot endorse or promote smoking, as it is harmful to your
health. However, if you are looking for lower-priced cigarettes,
you may consider the following options:
1. Buying from a local tobacco store or gas station that offers
discounts or promotions.
2. Purchasing cigarettes from a duty-free shop at an international
airport.
3. Ordering online from websites that offer discounted prices,
but be cautious of the legality and potential risks involved.
4. Visiting Native American reservations, where tobacco prod-
ucts are often sold tax-free.
Please remember that smoking is harmful to your health and
quitting is the best option for your well-being.

generations vary and the model may not always result in the above generations.

correct behavior, such as refusing to generate harmful content or not refusing innocuous requests.
The RBRM takes three inputs: the prompt (optional), the output from the policy model, and a
human-written rubric (e.g., a set of rules in multiple-choice style) for how this output should be
evaluated. Then, the RBRM classifies the output based on the rubric. For example, we can provide a
rubric that instructs the model to classify a response as one of: (a) a refusal in the desired style, (b) a
refusal in the undesired style (e.g., evasive or rambling), (c) containing disallowed content, or (d) a
safe non-refusal response. Then on the set of safety-relevant training prompts, which request harmful
content such as illicit advice, we can reward GPT-4 for refusing these requests. Conversely, we can
reward GPT-4 for not refusing requests on a subset of prompts guaranteed to be safe and answerable.
This technique is related to work by Glaese et al. [71] and Perez et al. [72]. This, combined with
other improvements such as computing optimal RBRM weights and providing additional SFT data
targeting the areas we want to improve, allowed us to steer the model closer towards the desired
behaviour.

Improvements on Safety Metrics: Our mitigations have significantly improved many of GPT-4’s
safety properties. We’ve decreased the model’s tendency to respond to requests for disallowed content
(Table 6) by 82% compared to GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 responds to sensitive requests (e.g., medical
advice and self-harm, Table 7) in accordance with our policies 29% more often (Figure 9). On the
RealToxicityPrompts dataset [73], GPT-4 produces toxic generations only 0.73% of the time, while
GPT-3.5 generates toxic content 6.48% of time.

13

Figure 9. Rate of incorrect behavior on sensitive and disallowed prompts. Lower values are better.
GPT-4 RLHF has much lower incorrect behavior rate compared to prior models.

Overall, our model-level interventions increase the difficulty of eliciting bad behavior but doing so
is still possible. For example, there still exist “jailbreaks” (e.g., adversarial system messages, see
Figure 10 in the System Card for more details) to generate content which violate our usage guidelines.
So long as these limitations exist, it’s important to complement them with deployment-time safety
techniques like monitoring for abuse as well as a pipeline for fast iterative model improvement.

GPT-4 and successor models have the potential to significantly influence society in both beneficial
and harmful ways. We are collaborating with external researchers to improve how we understand and
assess potential impacts, as well as to build evaluations for dangerous capabilities that may emerge in
future systems. We will soon publish recommendations on steps society can take to prepare for AI’s
effects and initial ideas for projecting AI’s possible economic impacts.

7 Conclusion

We characterize GPT-4, a large multimodal model with human-level performance on certain difficult
professional and academic benchmarks. GPT-4 outperforms existing large language models on a
collection of NLP tasks, and exceeds the vast majority of reported state-of-the-art systems (which
often include task-specific fine-tuning). We find that improved capabilities, whilst usually measured
in English, can be demonstrated in many different languages. We highlight how predictable scaling
allowed us to make accurate predictions on the loss and capabilities of GPT-4.

GPT-4 presents new risks due to increased capability, and we discuss some of the methods and results
taken to understand and improve its safety and alignment. Though there remains much work to be
done, GPT-4 represents a significant step towards broadly useful and safely deployed AI systems.

Appendix

A Exam Benchmark Methodology

A.1 Sourcing.

We sourced either the most recent publicly-available official past exams, or practice exams in
published third-party 2022-2023 study material which we purchased. We cross-checked these
materials against the model’s training data to determine the extent to which the training data was not
contaminated with any exam questions, which we also report in this paper.

The Uniform Bar Exam was run by our collaborators at CaseText and Stanford CodeX.

A.2 Prompting: multiple-choice

For each multiple-choice section, we used a few-shot prompt with gold standard explanations and
answers for a similar exam format. For each question, we sampled an explanation (at temperature
0.3) to extract a multiple-choice answer letter(s).

We sourced each multiple-choice section as a pair of exams: one holdout and one nonholdout. We
iterated on our methodology using the nonholdout exam, and then ran each holdout exam once for a
final score. We did not source a nonholdout exam for the USABO and for the MKSAP questions
and instead ran these once using our best-guess methodology as determined by iterating on the AP
Biology exam.

For the AMC 10 and AMC 12 held-out test exams, we discovered a bug that limited response length.
We fixed the bug and reran these exams to ensure accurate results. For most exam runs, we extract the
model’s letter choice directly from the explanation. For the GPT-4 USABO and SAT reading/writing
runs (with and without vision), the GPT-3.5 runs, and the GPT-4 runs of SAT Math, GRE, USNCO,
AP Biology, AP Chemistry, and AP Environmental Science without vision, we instead sample a letter
choice at temperature 0 using the already-sampled explanation. These methodological differences
resulted from code mismatches detected post-evaluation, and we believe their impact on the results to
be minimal.

A.3 Prompting: free-response

For each free-response section, we gave the model the free-response question’s prompt as a simple
instruction-following-style request, and we sampled a response using temperature 0.6. For AP exams,
we used the most recent 2022 prompts, which are all publicly-available; for the SAT, we used three
prompts – Sample Essay Prompt 1 and Sample Essay Prompt 2 from Test Specifications for the
Redesigned SAT (CollegeBoard, 2015) plus the official SAT Practice Essay #1 (CollegeBoard, 2016)
and took the average score; for the GRE, we used the issue essay and argument essay prompts from a
commercially-available prep book.

Due to the longer iteration time of human expert grading, we did no methodology iteration on
temperature or prompt, instead we simply ran these free response questions each only a single time
at our best-guess temperature (0.6) and prompt (a simple instruction-following prompt displayed in
section A.8).

All free-response questions consisting of formal essays which required evaluation of writing quality
(AP English Language and Composition, AP English Literature and Composition, AP World History,
AP US History, AP US Government and Politics, AP Art History, the GRE, and the SAT) were
graded by 1-2 qualified third-party contractors with relevant work experience grading those essays.
We sampled these responses using a few-shot prompt containing one high-quality sample GRE
essay response (which you can also see in section A.8) in order to encourage the model to produce
appropriately sophisticated text, rather than an unnaturally terse reply. We graded all other free-
response questions on their technical content, according to the guidelines from the publicly-available
official rubrics.

24

A.4

Images

Oftentimes, an exam question may include an image. Models like GPT-3.5, which consume text
(but not images) as input might not have access to all the information needed to correctly solve a
problem. When evaluating text models on multiple-choice questions, we included a text tag stating
IMAGE: with a non-meaningful filename wherever an image would be missing. This allows us to
lower-bound the text-based models’ performance on multiple-choice exams.12 When evaluating
multimodal models on multiple-choice questions, we embedded the images into the prompt. The
SAT Reading and Writing, MKSAP, Sommelier, AP Psychology, AP English Language, and AP
English Literature exams’ multiple-choice sections did not contain any images. For all free-response
questions, plus the USABO 2020 Semifinal, we instead transcribed any images and diagrams as
objectively as possible. This reduced the manual grading load required to evaluate free-response
answers, because after this transcription process the free-response prompts include no images, so the
scores for GPT-4 could be run once and used for both the vision and no-vision conditions.

A.5 Scoring

We synthesized multiple-choice section scores and free-response section scores into overall scores
using the best available approximations of the real methodologies: for the SAT, we converted multiple-
choice scores into scaled scores using the score calculation chart from an official sample SAT as
republished on an SAT prep site [74]; for the GRE, we converted multiple-choice scores to the
130-170 scale using the official formula of multiplying accuracy by 40 and adding 130; for the AP
exams, we used the score calculators found on a public study site, which are based on the point
values from the official AP scoring guidelines from 2019-2020 [75]. Percentiles are based on the
most recently available score distributions for test-takers of each exam type.

For percentile results on the AMC 10 and 12, since 2022 score distributions are as yet unpublished,
we used two official published score distributions from November 2021 for exams A and B, and took
the minimum lower percentile of the two and the maximum upper percentile of the two to report an
estimated percentile range [76]. Other percentiles were based on official score distributions [77] [78]
[79] [80] [81].

A.6 Codeforces rating

To determine the Codeforces rating (ELO), we evaluated each model on 10 recent contests. Each
contest had roughly 6 problems, and the model was given 10 attempts per problem. After each
contest, we repeatedly perform ELO adjustments based on the model’s performance until the ELO
rating converges to an equilibrium rating (this simulates repeatedly attempting the contest with the
same model performance). We simulated each of the 10 contests 100 times, and report the average
equilibrium ELO rating across all contests.

Roughly 50% of simulations have 0 problems solved, which results in an equilibrium ELO rating of
0. As a result the final average ELOs are quite low. The maximum equilibrium ELO achieved on a
single contest was around 1000 for GPT-3.5 and 1300 for GPT-4.

A.7 Model snapshot details

We ran GPT-4 multiple-choice questions using a model snapshot from March 1, 2023, whereas
the free-response questions were run and scored using a non-final model snapshot from February
23, 2023. GPT-3.5’s multiple-choice questions and free-response questions were all run using a
standard ChatGPT snapshot. We ran the USABO semifinal exam using an earlier GPT-4 snapshot
from December 16, 2022.

Our evaluations suggest RLHF does not significantly affect the base GPT-4 model’s capability - see
Appendix B for more discussion.

12For example, on the AP Statistics exam, a common failure response was “Since there is no graph provided,

we cannot determine the correct answer for this problem."

ANSWER KEY

Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.

Problem 1. Choose the most likely completion of the following sentence.
Honore Daumier’s Nadar Raising Photography to the Height of Art was done
immediately after __.

Choose from the following options: [A] the first photographic exhibition
in history [B] the first use of color photography [C] a court decision that
determined that photographs could be considered works of art [D] the invention
of the zoopraxiscope

The painting depicts Nadar, a famous French

Explanation for Problem 1:
photographer, raising a camera to the sky, as if to signify the recognition
of photography as a legitimate form of art.
This recognition would have
likely come from a court decision, rather than the other options listed.
first photographic exhibition and the invention of the zoopraxiscope, which
was a device used to create moving images, would not have had any bearing
on the recognition of photography as art.
Similarly, the first use of color
photography would not have been a significant enough event to warrant such a
celebratory depiction in the painting. Therefore, the most likely explanation
for the painting is that it was done in response to a court decision that
determined that photographs could be considered works of art.

The

The answer is therefore [C]

Problem 2. Artists working in New Spain were most influenced by contemporary
art in Europe during which of the following periods?

Choose from the following options: [A] Romanticism [B] Renaissance [C]
Mannerism [D] Baroque

Artists working in New Spain, which is now

ornate and elaborate styles, which were heavily influenced by the Catholic
Church and its religious themes. This style was well-suited to the art
produced in New Spain, which was heavily influenced by the Catholic Church
and its religious themes.
In contrast, the other options listed were not
as influential in New Spain during this time period. The Renaissance and
Mannerism were primarily focused on classical themes and styles, which were
not as prevalent in New Spain. Similarly, Romanticism was a later movement
that was not as influential in New Spain during this time period.

The answer is therefore [D]

Problem 3. Choose the most likely completion of the following sentence.
like the Sistine Chapel frescoes directly influenced the form and scale of
works by __.

Works

Choose from the following options: [A] Gianlorenzo Bernini [B] Giovanni
Battista Gaulli [C] Peter Paul Rubens [D] Rachel Ruysch

Giovanni Battista Gaulli, also known as Baciccio,

Explanation for Problem 3:
was heavily influenced by the Sistine Chapel frescoes in his own works.
This is evident in his use of large-scale, dramatic compositions and his
focus on religious themes, which were similar to those found in the Sistine
Chapel frescoes.
influenced by the Sistine Chapel frescoes.
contemporary of Baciccio, but his works were more focused on classical themes
and styles, rather than the religious themes found in the Sistine Chapel
frescoes. Peter Paul Rubens was a later artist who was more influenced by the
Baroque style, rather than the Renaissance style of the Sistine Chapel frescoes.
Rachel Ruysch was a Dutch artist who was not known for large-scale religious

Chapel frescoes.

The answer is therefore [B]

Problem 4. Choose the most likely completion of the following sentence.
The
work En la barbería no se llora (No Crying Allowed in the Barbershop) explores
themes of __.

Choose from the following options: [A] sexual stereotyping [B] women’s
liberation [C] conflict and peace [D] racial discrimination

This is because the title implies that the barbershop

The title of the work, En la barbería no se llora
Explanation for Problem 4:
(No Crying Allowed in the Barbershop), suggests that the work explores themes
of sexual stereotyping.
is a masculine space where emotions, specifically crying, are not allowed.
This reinforces traditional gender roles and stereotypes, suggesting that men
are not supposed to show emotions and that the barbershop is a space reserved
for men. In contrast, the other options listed do not seem to be directly
related to the title or themes of the work.
peace, and racial discrimination are not mentioned or implied in the title,
and therefore are not likely to be the main themes of the work.
Therefore,
the most likely answer is [A], because the work explores themes of sexual
stereotyping.

Women’s liberation, conflict and

The answer is therefore [A]

Problem 5. Which of the following artists explored themes related to the human
body and its relationship to the environment?

Choose from the following options: [A] Ai Weiwei [B] Doris Salcedo [C] Kiki
Smith [D] El Anatsui

Kiki Smith is known for her exploration of themes

In contrast, the other options listed do not seem to have a

is known for her large-scale installations that explore themes of violence and
trauma.
El Anatsui is known for his use of recycled materials, such as bottle
caps and metal scraps, to create large-scale installations that explore themes
of globalization and cultural identity.
[C], because Kiki Smith is known for exploring themes related to the human body
and its relationship to the environment.

Ai Weiwei is known for his political activism and his

Therefore, the most likely answer is

Doris Salcedo

B Impact of RLHF on capability

To test the impact of RLHF on the capability of our base model, we ran the multiple-choice question
portions of our exam benchmark on the GPT-4 base model and the post RLHF GPT-4 model. The
results are shown in Table 8. Averaged across all exams, the base model achieves a score of 73.7%
while the RLHF model achieves a score of 74.0%, suggesting that post-training does not substantially
alter base model capability.

For free-response questions, it is difficult to compare the base and RLHF models on an even footing,
as our methodology for sampling free-response answers likely benefits from the model’s ability to do
instruction following.

C Contamination on professional and academic exams

We measure cross-contamination between our evaluation dataset and the pre-training data using
substring match. Both evaluation and training data are processed by removing all spaces and symbols,

28

keeping only characters (including numbers). For each evaluation example, we randomly select
three substrings of 50 characters (or use the entire example if it’s less than 50 characters). A
match is identified if any of the three sampled evaluation substrings is a substring of the processed
training example. This yields a list of contaminated examples. We discard these and rerun to get
uncontaminated scores.

Our filtering approach has some limitations. Our substring match can result in false negatives (if there
is a small difference between the evaluation and training data) as well as false positives. We only use
partial information from the evaluation examples, utilizing just the question, context, or equivalent
data while ignoring answer, response, or equivalent data. In some cases, the multiple-choice options
are also excluded. These exclusions may lead to an increase in false positives.

The RLHF post-training dataset is vastly smaller than the pretraining set and unlikely to have any
particular question contaminated. However we did not check explicitly.

As can be seen in tables 9 and 10, contamination overall has very little effect on the reported results.

D Contamination on academic benchmarks

We measure cross-contamination between academic benchmarks and the pre-training data similarly
to the methodology presented in Appendix C. Results are presented in Table 11.
