GPT-4 Technical Report

OpenAI

Abstract

We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.

Introduction

This technical report presents GPT-4, a large multimodal model capable of processing image and text inputs and producing text outputs. Such models are an important area of study as they have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, such as dialogue systems, text summarization, and machine translation. As such, they have been the subject of substantial interest and progress in recent years [1–34].

One of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate natural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios. To test its capabilities in such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans. In these evaluations it performs quite well and often outscores the vast majority of human test takers. For example, on a simulated bar exam, GPT-4 achieves a score that falls in the top 10% of test takers. This contrasts with GPT-3.5, which scores in the bottom 10%.

On a suite of traditional NLP benchmarks, GPT-4 outperforms both previous large language models and most state-of-the-art systems (which often have benchmark-specific training or hand-engineering). On the MMLU benchmark [35, 36], an English-language suite of multiple-choice questions covering 57 subjects, GPT-4 not only outperforms existing models by a considerable margin in English, but also demonstrates strong performance in other languages. On translated variants of MMLU, GPT-4 surpasses the English-language state-of-the-art in 24 of 26 languages considered. We discuss these model capability results, as well as model safety improvements and results, in more detail in later sections.

This report also discusses a key challenge of the project, developing deep learning infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to make predictions about the expected performance of GPT-4 (based on small runs trained in similar ways) that were tested against the final run to increase confidence in our training.

Despite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations to earlier GPT models [1, 37, 38]: it is not fully reliable (e.g. can suffer from "hallucinations"), has a limited context window, and does not learn from experience. Care should be taken when using the outputs of GPT-4, particularly in contexts where reliability is important.

GPT-4's capabilities and limitations create significant and novel safety challenges, and we believe careful study of these challenges is an important area of research given the potential societal impact. This report includes an extensive system card (after the Appendix) describing some of the risks we foresee around bias, disinformation, over-reliance, privacy, cybersecurity, proliferation, and more. It also describes interventions we made to mitigate potential harms from the deployment of GPT-4, including adversarial testing with domain experts, and a model-assisted safety pipeline.

Scope and Limitations of this Technical Report

This report focuses on the capabilities, limitations, and safety properties of GPT-4. GPT-4 is a Transformer-style model [39] pre-trained to predict the next token in a document, using both publicly available data (such as internet data) and data licensed from third-party providers. The model was then fine-tuned using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [40]. Given both the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models like GPT-4, this report contains no further details about the architecture (including model size), hardware, training compute, dataset construction, training method, or similar.

We are committed to independent auditing of our technologies, and shared some initial steps and ideas in this area in the system card accompanying this release.2 We plan to make further technical details available to additional third parties who can advise us on how to weigh the competitive and safety considerations above against the scientific value of further transparency.

Predictable Scaling

A large focus of the GPT-4 project was building a deep learning stack that scales predictably. The primary reason is that for very large training runs like GPT-4, it is not feasible to do extensive model-specific tuning. To address this, we developed infrastructure and optimization methods that have very predictable behavior across multiple scales. These improvements allowed us to reliably predict some aspects of the performance of GPT-4 from smaller models trained using 1,000–10,000× less compute.

Loss Prediction

The final loss of properly-trained large language models is thought to be well approximated by power laws in the amount of compute used to train the model [41, 42, 2, 14, 15].

To verify the scalability of our optimization infrastructure, we predicted GPT-4's final loss on our internal codebase (not part of the training set) by fitting a scaling law with an irreducible loss term (as in Henighan et al. [15]): L(C) = aC^b + c, from models trained using the same methodology but using at most 10,000x less compute than GPT-4. This prediction was made shortly after the run started, without use of any partial results. The fitted scaling law predicted GPT-4's final loss with high accuracy (Figure 1).

Scaling of Capabilities on HumanEval

Having a sense of the capabilities of a model before training can improve decisions around alignment, safety, and deployment. In addition to predicting final loss, we developed methodology to predict more interpretable metrics of capability. One such metric is pass rate on the HumanEval dataset [43], which measures the ability to synthesize Python functions of varying complexity. We successfully predicted the pass rate on a subset of the HumanEval dataset by extrapolating from models trained with at most 1,000× less compute (Figure 2).

For an individual problem in HumanEval, performance may occasionally worsen with scale. Despite these challenges, we find an approximate power law relationship

E_P[log(pass_rate(C))] = α - β * C^(-k)

where k and α are positive constants, and P is a subset of problems in the dataset. We hypothesize that this relationship holds for all problems in this dataset. In practice, very low pass rates are difficult or impossible to estimate, so we restrict to problems P and models M such that given some large sample budget, every problem is solved at least once by every model.

We registered predictions for GPT-4's performance on HumanEval before training completed, using only information available prior to training. All but the 15 hardest HumanEval problems were split into 6 difficulty buckets based on the performance of smaller models. The results on the 3rd easiest bucket are shown in Figure 2, showing that the resulting predictions were very accurate for this subset of HumanEval problems where we can accurately estimate log(pass_rate) for several smaller models. Predictions on the other five buckets performed almost as well, the main exception being GPT-4 underperforming our predictions on the easiest bucket.

Certain capabilities remain hard to predict. For example, the Inverse Scaling Prize [44] proposed several tasks for which model performance decreases as a function of scale. Similarly to a recent result by Wei et al. [45], we find that GPT-4 reverses this trend, as shown on one of the tasks called Hindsight Neglect [46] in Figure 3.

We believe that accurately predicting future capabilities is important for safety. Going forward we plan to refine these methods and register performance predictions across various capabilities before large model training begins, and we hope this becomes a common goal in the field.

Capabilities

We tested GPT-4 on a diverse set of benchmarks, including simulating exams that were originally designed for humans.4 We did no specific training for these exams. A minority of the problems in the exams were seen by the model during training; for each exam we run a variant with these questions removed and report the lower score of the two. We believe the results to be representative. For further details on contamination (methodology and per-exam statistics), see Appendix C.

Exams were sourced from publicly-available materials. Exam questions included both multiple-choice and free-response questions; we designed separate prompts for each format, and images were included in the input for questions which required it. The evaluation setup was designed based on performance on a validation set of exams, and we report final results on held-out test exams. Overall scores were determined by combining multiple-choice and free-response question scores using publicly available methodologies for each exam. We estimate and report the percentile each overall score corresponds to. See Appendix A for further details on the exam evaluation methodology.

GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on the majority of these professional and academic exams. Notably, it passes a simulated version of the Uniform Bar Examination with a score in the top 10% of test takers (Table 1, Figure 4).

The model's capabilities on exams appear to stem primarily from the pre-training process and are not significantly affected by RLHF. On multiple choice questions, both the base GPT-4 model and the RLHF model perform equally well on average across the exams we tested (see Appendix B).

We also evaluated the pre-trained base GPT-4 model on traditional benchmarks designed for evaluating language models. For each benchmark we report, we ran contamination checks for test data appearing in the training set (see Appendix D for full details on per-benchmark contamination).5 We used few-shot prompting [1] for all benchmarks when evaluating GPT-4.6

GPT-4 considerably outperforms existing language models, as well as previously state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems which often have benchmark-specific crafting or additional training protocols (Table 2).

Many existing ML benchmarks are written in English. To gain an initial understanding of GPT-4's capabilities in other languages, we translated the MMLU benchmark [35, 36] – a suite of multiple-choice problems spanning 57 subjects – into a variety of languages using Azure Translate (see Appendix F for example translations and prompts). We find that GPT-4 outperforms the English-language performance of GPT 3.5 and existing language models (Chinchilla [2] and PaLM [3]) for the majority of languages we tested, including low-resource languages such as Latvian, Welsh, and Swahili (Figure 5).

GPT-4 substantially improves over previous models in the ability to follow user intent [63]. On a dataset of 5,214 prompts submitted to ChatGPT [64] and the OpenAI API [47], the responses generated by GPT-4 were preferred over the responses generated by GPT-3.5 on 70.2% of prompts.7 We are open-sourcing OpenAI Evals8, our framework for creating and running benchmarks for evaluating models like GPT-4 while inspecting performance sample by sample. Evals is compatible with existing benchmarks, and can be used to track performance of models in deployment. We plan to increase the diversity of these benchmarks over time to represent a wider set of failure modes and a harder set of tasks.

Visual Inputs

GPT-4 accepts prompts consisting of both images and text, which – parallel to the text-only setting – lets the user specify any vision or language task. Specifically, the model generates text outputs given inputs consisting of arbitrarily interlaced text and images. Over a range of domains – including documents with text and photographs, diagrams, or screenshots – GPT-4 exhibits similar capabilities as it
