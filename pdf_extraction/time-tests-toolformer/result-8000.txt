Based on the examples provided, the API calls generated by the model seem generally useful and relevant to the given text context. A few key observations:

1. The Wikipedia search results provide helpful background information to supplement the original text, such as details about the Flodden Window war memorial and the origins of the "Fast Train to Success" song.

2. The calculator API is used appropriately to perform arithmetic operations and conversions mentioned in the text, like calculating the ratio of Venus' temperature to Earth's.

3. The calendar API is used to determine the current date, which is relevant context for interpreting details about event openings and an Easter egg hunt.

4. The question answering API is leveraged to look up specific facts, like the length of the Nile river.

The values of Li- - Li+ generally align with the perceived usefulness of the API calls - higher values correspond to calls that provide relevant information to predict upcoming tokens, while lower values indicate less helpful calls. There are a few exceptions, like the "Fast train success" search, but overall the model seems to be making sensible decisions about when and how to utilize the available tools. This suggests the self-supervised approach is effective at identifying useful API usage patterns without relying on human-labeled demonstrations.
