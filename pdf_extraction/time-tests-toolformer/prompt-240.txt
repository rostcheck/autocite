Abstract

Language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable
abilities to solve new tasks from just a few
examples or textual instructions, especially at
scale. They also, paradoxically, struggle with
basic functionality, such as arithmetic or fac-
tual lookup, where much simpler and smaller
In this paper, we show that
models excel.
LMs can teach themselves to use external tools
via simple APIs and achieve the best of both
worlds. We introduce Toolformer, a model
trained to decide which APIs to call, when to
call them, what arguments to pass, and how to
best incorporate the results into future token
prediction. This is done in a self-supervised
way, requiring nothing more than a
